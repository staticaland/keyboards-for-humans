# For humans

[**Keyboardio Model 01**](https://keyboard.io/) - Probably the greatest keyboard ever made. Open source firmware. Highly extensible. Great [community](https://community.keyboard.io/)!

[Kinesis Advantage2](https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/advantage2-keyboard/) - It has no silent switches, which makes it questionable for open office use. Keyboardio Model 01 is easier to transport and can be tilted in any way imaginable.
